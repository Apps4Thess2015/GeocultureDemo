#Installation
In order to install the GeoCulture app in your Android device , first of all you should have Android 14 (Ice Cream Sandwich) or higher.

Download the GeoCulture.apk from the "releases" section.
When the download is complete, find the file in your file system and click on it, or click on the notification to launch the executable.
A dialog will appear , saying that the insallation is blocked because this is not a production release . Choose "Settings" and in settings check the "Unknown Sources" section and click ok.
Accept the permissions which are requested and click install. This should lead to a correct installation. You are ready to open the app now.

This procedure may vary due to different android versions and skins, but the concept is the same.
